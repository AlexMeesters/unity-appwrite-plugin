///// Installing UniTask

This package relies on UniTask, a package that uses a lot less allocations for C# Tasks.
It also makes deploying to WebGL easier as regular Tasks cause errors with WebGL.
To install UniTask go here: https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask#upm-package

///// Installing JSON.Net

JSON.Net is used to generate JSON for the requests, as well as deserialize responses from Appwrite.
Reason I did not choose for the JsonUtility was because the underlying queries could still change, 
and this allowed me to just fetch specific parameters.

To install JSON.Net add the following to the manifest.json in /YourProjectFolder/Packages/manifest.json
"com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json": "2.0.1-preview.1",


///// Example scenes require TextMeshPro to view

Go to the package manager and locate TextMeshPro and install it.


///// Finally

Once the project is installed and no errors occur. Run the game, and a 
file called "Appwrite Config" should appear in the Resources folder.
Configure it to connect to your Appwrite server. 


///// Remarks

This package has not been battle tested. Use at your own discretion.
Good luck with your project and I hope this bit of code helps you move further.
